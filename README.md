# useeior

`useeior` is an R package for building and using [USEEIO models](https://www.epa.gov/land-research/us-environmentally-extended-input-output-useeio-models). The [model object](format_specs/model.md) is the primary output that is built according to a given [model specification](format_specs/ModelSpecification.md) and optional [disaggregation specification](format_specs/DisaggregationSpecification.md). [Model specifications](inst/extdata/modelspecs) and associated [disaggregation specifications](inst/extdata/disaggspecs) for EPA-validated models are included in the package. The package offers various functions for validating, calculating, visualizing, and writing out models or their components. `useeior` is a core component of the [USEEIO Modeling Framework](https://github.com/USEPA/useeio).

`useeior` is in a beta development state. See [Releases](https://github.com/USEPA/useeior/releases) for working and tested versions.
